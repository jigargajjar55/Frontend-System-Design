## 🚀 Getting Started

Each folder contains:
- `index.html` - HTML markup
- `script.js` - JavaScript implementation
- `style.css` - Styling (where applicable)

To view any project, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### System Design & Architecture
- Component-based UI design
- State management patterns
- Performance optimization (debouncing, throttling)
- Event handling and delegation

### JavaScript Fundamentals
- Closures and scope
- Prototypes and inheritance
- Function context (`this` keyword)
- Async patterns (Promises, callbacks)
- Array and object methods

### Frontend Patterns
- Infinite scrolling
- Search with pagination
- Event bubbling/capturing
- Storage mechanisms

### Advanced Implementations
- Polyfills for native methods
- Custom data structures
- Algorithm visualization
- UI component building

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. Start with **JSConcepts/** to build strong JavaScript fundamentals
2. Move to **CodingQuestions/** to apply knowledge to practical problems
3. Tackle **MachineCoding/** projects to build complete systems

## 💡 Use Cases
